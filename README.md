Worked with a team to analyze the requirements of a real client to help them implement a Chronic Care Management system to their practice

This project was done through the classes Innovations for Industry (I4I) and Project Management at Juniata College. 
The point of the class is to work with a real client and apply project management skills to complete an IT project for the client. 
The i4i-*.pdf files are the two documents our team produced for the client.
pm-final-doc.pdf is the final deliverable we created for the actual class, this has more details about the project management process taken throughout the project.
